# Hermes KanbanWebUI Design

KanbanWebUI uses an Expo-inspired clean operations cockpit:

- white canvas, soft sky-blue wash, near-black ink
- black primary CTA, blue secondary actions
- hairline borders and rounded white cards
- Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for ids/logs
- Trello-like horizontal columns on desktop
- mobile focused-column carousel with bottom drawer
- Traditional Chinese (`zh-Hant`) labels by default, English toggle in the top bar

This file is intentionally small and project-local. The source inspiration was
`awesome-design-md` catalog slug `expo`; CSS tokens live in
`static/design-tokens.css`.
